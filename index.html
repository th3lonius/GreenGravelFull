            <p class="col-1">The Green Gravel Comedy Festival is a three-day alternative comedy festival in multiple venues in the town of Toledo, Iowa. Offering affordable, accessible shows and workshops in alternative comedy, Green Gravel aims to bring the finest comedic voices to the heart of Iowa. Our fest is made possible by the community of Toledo in conjunction with sponsors, partnerships and volunteer contributions. It’s time. Because Iowa laughs harder.</p>

            <p class="col-2">We’re proud to bring an array of the finest stand-up, podcast, improv and sketch comedians to Toledo, and we don’t believe that patrons should have to pay an arm and a leg to do it. That’s why we’re offering affordable options for ticketing: you can pop in for a single show, buy a day pass or snap up the Green Graveller weekend pass. You won’t be getting comedy-clubbed to death by minimum-drink charges; furthermore, we’ll be offering drink/merch specials as a thank-you to the folks who make the gravel strip comedy trip!</p>

                    <article>
                        <p>The lovely Wieting Theater serves as the primary venue for Green Gravel. The Wieting has brought fine arts ranging from live opera to 3D movies to the Toledo region since 1912. This 300-seat balcony-tiered gem has been restored and maintained by the community, showcasing the tireless work and cultural heritage of the people of Toledo. We’re honored to host our event here and can’t wait to share this completely unique live, hilarious experience with you!</p>

                        <p>Just down the block from The Wieting Theater, across from the Tama County courthouse, sits a local institution for gourmet pizza, quality karaoke and late-night spirits for locals and visitors alike. This first-generation pool hall has been the hitching post for many a weary worker for over 2 decades and is owned/operated with pride by the Musgrave family. Bumblebee’s will be hosting comedy events in conjunction with those at the Wieting and the American Legion Post 72.</p>

                        <p>Located just across the town square from both The Wieting Theater and Bumblebee's, this building has been housing veteran and/or family activities for over thirty years. Boasting a full bar with numerous activity spaces, this Legion Hall will be the epicenter for our workshops, group shows and other distinct performances! We're thrilled to be curating some of our very best work in a space that has meant so much to the Toledo community.</p>
