<p>The Green Gravel Comedy Festival is a three-day alternative comedy festival in multiple venues in the town of Toledo, Iowa. Offering affordable, accessible shows and workshops in alternative comedy, Green Gravel aims to bring the finest comedic voices to the heart of Iowa. Our fest is made possible by the community of Toledo in conjunction with sponsors, partnerships and volunteer contributions. It’s time. Because Iowa laughs harder.</p>

<p>We’re proud to bring an array of the finest stand-up, podcast, improv and sketch comedians to Toledo, and we don’t believe that patrons should have to pay an arm and a leg to do it. That’s why we’re offering affordable options for ticketing: you can pop in for a single show, buy a day pass or snap up the Green Graveller weekend pass. You won’t be getting comedy-clubbed to death by minimum-drink charges; furthermore, we’ll be offering drink/merch specials as a thank-you to the folks who make the gravel strip comedy trip!</p>
